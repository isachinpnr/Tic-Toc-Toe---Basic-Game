Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple and fun version of the classic two-player game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides an interactive experience for two players who take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features
Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.
Real-Time Gameplay: Watch as the grid updates instantly after each player's turn.
Win Detection: Automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
Game Reset: Easy-to-use reset functionality that allows you to play again without refreshing the page.
